INTRODUCTION
 
Plant diseases mainly effect on the quantity and quality of the agriculture production. Plant diseases directly lead to slow growth of the crops. The famer concentrates on the cause of the disease in crop during its growth, but it is not easy to recognize the disease on the spot .This effect the production cost and as well as profit of the farmers in the agriculture. Due to the plants disease farmers can’t produce crops in high quantity which result in food shortage and has to face economic loss of county. If plant disease are not identified in time food shortage will increase. For protecting the plants form the disease early detection of the diseases is basis for effective prevention and control of pants diseases, reduction of economic losses in agriculture and they also paly vital role in management and decision making of agriculture production. Infected plants usually show marks or lesions on leaves, stems, flower, and fruits. Generally, each disease or pest conditions present unique visible pattern that can be used to identify the abnormalities present in the plants. Usually, the leaves of the plants are prime source for identifying the plants diseases and the most of symptoms of the pants disease is present in the leaves. Recently technologies are converged in various industry fields each other. Agriculture crop yield is greatly affected by many pests and diseases. In order to improve the yield, early diagnosis and control of disease are very important. Since long time, soybean is considered as meat, milk, cheese, bread as well as oil for the people of China and East Asia. This research of countries called soybean as “gold from the soil”. The main Brazilian agricultural product has been Soybean, contributing significantly to the country’s trade balance. Soybean is the rapid growing crop in India and it is considered as a Kharif crop. The leading producer of soybean in India is Madhya Pradesh, followed by Maharashtra and Rajasthan. Around the world Soybean is recognized as one of the outstanding crops. It is majorly used for protein, animal feed and vegetable oil. Soybean is considered to be an important food commodity because of its high protein content greater than 40% and high oil content greater than 20%. Since the Soya Protein supplies a sufficient amount of amino acids, it is called complete protein. Soybean oil does not contain cholesterol. Low yield is the major problem with the soya industry of the country because diseases are one of the reasons. Soybeans are affected by several diseases like downy mildew, pod and stem blight, phytophthora root and stem rot, brown spot, cercopsora leaf blight, purple seed stain, frogeye leaf spot and many more.
